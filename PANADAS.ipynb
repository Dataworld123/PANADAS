    "Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- In Pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that can store data of different types (numeric, string, boolean, etc.) in a tabular format. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, where data is organized in rows and columns. Each column in a DataFrame represents a variable, and each row represents an observation or record.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of a single data type, like a list or an array. It is similar to a column in a DataFrame, but it doesn't have column names. Instead, it has an index, which labels each element in the Series.\n",

    "Panel: A Panel is a three-dimensional data structure in Pandas, which was used to handle 3D data in older versions. However, it has been deprecated, and the recommendation is to use other data structures like Series and DataFrame for most use cases. Panels are not mutable like Series and DataFrame.\n",
